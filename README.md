This project involves developing a responsive web application for a food restaurant utilizing HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and SQL. The application features a user login page and provides a range of functionalities for users, including searching for food items, creating user accounts, adding items to a cart, and completing the checkout process. Additionally, there is a dedicated admin panel with a separate login system. The admin can manage all restaurant operations, including viewing and handling orders, managing registered users, and responding to reviews.
